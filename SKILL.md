# Enzyme

Enzyme builds a concept graph from your vault's tags, links, folders, and timestamps. Queries resolve against **catalysts** — pre-computed thematic questions that bridge content. 8ms queries, local embeddings.

Vault path: `-p` flag > `ENZYME_VAULT_ROOT` env var > current directory.

Prerequisite: the Enzyme CLI binary must already be installed. If this skill is loaded, runtime instructions are already available; do not call `enzyme install <runtime>` as part of normal vault setup.

For Hermes, this skill is for operational use inside a user's workspace, not for developing Hermes itself. Run Enzyme from the directory where Hermes is launched so the same `AGENTS.md`/`.hermes.md` context and markdown corpus are visible to both.

Respect the user's existing markdown system. Enzyme should read Obsidian-style folders, inboxes, daily notes, people pages, tags, wikilinks, and frontmatter conventions before suggesting any structure. Do not impose a memory schema or context tree; use existing structure as retrieval signal and propose optional backfills only when the user asks for setup help. Prefer tags for recurring ideas and wikilinks for people, projects, companies, decisions, and concepts before creating folders or person-specific structures. Preserve existing note-level entity fields such as `people:`, `organizations:`, `companies:`, `clients:`, `projects:`, and `relationships:`.

If the vault isn't initialized (no `.enzyme/enzyme.db`), run first-time setup from the vault root. Setup should demonstrate what Enzyme can already do with the vault, not ask the user to design a memory architecture.

```bash
enzyme scan
# Read the structured scan evidence and produce a setup preview.
enzyme scan --write-config
# Read and tune ~/.enzyme/config.toml before init.
enzyme init --quiet
enzyme petri
# Show the active map, then simulate one useful prompt.
enzyme petri --query "<simulated user prompt>"
enzyme catalyze "<query composed from prompt + petri catalyst vocabulary>"
```

Before `enzyme scan --write-config`, use `enzyme scan` as the primary evidence for setup. Read the structured fields directly, do only bounded follow-up when the scan is ambiguous, then show a concrete setup preview and ask for corrections before writing config or editing files.

Minimal repairs must be small, reversible, and based on existing conventions: adding missing date frontmatter to date-named notes, adding `people:`/`projects:` fields only where those fields already exist and exact wikilinks are present, adding a few central wikilinks to obvious notes, or excluding runtime/generated folders from config. Do not move files, create a new taxonomy, generate summaries, or bulk-normalize the vault during first setup. If the user declines, initialize as-is and still demonstrate value; after the demo, offer the remaining refinements as optional next steps.

If the vault uses Obsidian, optionally offer capture templates after the demo. Core Obsidian Templates are enough for simple date/time templates inserted into a note, and Daily notes can apply a daily template. Do not require new plugins during Enzyme setup. Frame templates as optional capture affordances for future new notes, not prerequisites: they help users create inbox/daily/meeting/project notes with existing date/tag/wikilink handles so Enzyme can build on them later.

Before `enzyme init`, read `~/.enzyme/config.toml` after `enzyme scan --write-config` and compare it with the scan evidence. Add missing important markdown folders as `folder:<path>` entries when they are central to the workspace and not covered by a parent. Common folders include `inbox`, `daily`, `journal`, `docs`, `notes`, `research`, `logs`, `decisions`, `meetings`, `transcripts`, `sessions`, `projects`, `areas`, `resources`, `people`, `contacts`, `clients`, and `companies`. Keep the entity list focused; prefer scan-backed top-level surfaces over every subfolder. For expandable folders, look for scan/petri evidence that a selected folder contains page files that are also wikilinks elsewhere (`page_entities`, `page_entity_children`, `sampled_children`, `catalyzed_children`, or similar folder-page evidence). In Rust Enzyme, selecting the parent folder is usually enough: the selection pipeline auto-detects expandable folders, caps/ranks children, and materializes child page links as their own catalyst entities. Do not manually add every child wikilink to config just because it lives in a selected folder; add a child link separately only when it has a distinct role independent of the parent folder. Use profile overrides only when the posture is clear. Loose examples: people/relationships → `relational`; projects/work/inbox → `operational`; product/strategy/decisions → `decision_trace`; Readwise/research/PKM → `resonance_trace`; journal/daily/writing → `reflective`; faith/philosophy/tradeoffs → `tension_trace`; taste/feedback/activity logs → `preference_evidence`. Example TOML entity: `{ "folder:people" = { profile = "relational" } }`. Leave ambiguous entities un-overridden rather than guessing. Keep runtime/build folders excluded: `.hermes`, `.enzyme`, `.git`, `.claude`, `.agents`, `.codex`, `.codex-work`, `.pi`, `.local`, `.obsidian`, `node_modules`, `target`, `dist`, `build`, and templates. For persistent `targets = [...]` / `enzyme apply` targets, use raw filesystem paths or vault-relative directory paths such as `Readwise/Books` or `../research`; do not prefix them with `folder:` and do not use tag/wikilink syntax.

For voice agents that need to start the first turn before the full init barrier,
use `enzyme init --voice-ready --voice-entities 3 --voice-min-catalysts 1`.
It returns once seed petri context exists; semantic search becomes available
after the detached init worker finishes.

## Session Lifecycle

What's automatic depends on your runtime:

**Hermes** (hooks handle it):
- **First setup** — the plugin can bootstrap the binary; the workspace still needs `enzyme scan`, TOML validation, and `enzyme init` once
- **Session start** — binary bootstrap + `enzyme refresh` run automatically
- **Each turn** — `enzyme petri --query` injects vault context before the model sees your message
- **Session end** — after any useful markdown notes are written, `enzyme refresh` indexes them

**OpenClaw** (skill instructions + config):
- **Session start** — run `enzyme refresh --quiet` (add to AGENTS.md or heartbeat)
- **First turn / context-dependent turns** — run `enzyme petri --query "user's message"` before responding, unless the plugin already injected petri context
- **Session end** — write useful markdown notes if the session produced durable memory, then run `enzyme refresh --quiet`
- **Between sessions** — heartbeat or cron can keep the index fresh for external syncs (see README for config)

In both cases: you call petri and catalyze as tools. The difference is whether context injection is automatic (Hermes hooks) or agent-driven (OpenClaw skill instructions).

## Tools

### `enzyme petri` — vault context

```bash
enzyme petri                            # entities by recency
enzyme petri --query "user's question"  # ranked by relevance
```

Petri is your working memory. Run it on the user's first message to get relevant entities and catalyst vocabulary. Compose catalyze queries using that vocabulary — catalysts reach content the user's raw words won't find.

You don't need session logs. The vault's full history is already indexed. Notes you write this session get picked up on next refresh, shift entity trends, and surface in future petri calls automatically.

### `enzyme catalyze "query"` — semantic search

```bash
enzyme catalyze "feeling stuck"
enzyme catalyze "what I decided about X" --register continuity
```

**`--register`**: `explore` (default) for patterns, `continuity` for restoring prior decisions, `reference` for capture patterns.

Use grep for exact anchors (names, tags, wikilinks). Use catalyze when you only have a theme.

### `enzyme apply ./target-dir` — project the vault's lens onto external refs

```bash
enzyme apply ./target-dir
enzyme catalyze "query" --target ./target-dir
```

Apply indexes external content using the source vault's catalysts:

```text
source vault catalysts → external target chunks
```

Use it when the user wants to draw from outside material without merging it into memory: Readwise exports, article/book folders, transcripts, research dumps, client docs, code repos, converted PDFs, Discord/Slack exports, or downloaded archives. Search both the vault and the target when comparison matters:

```bash
enzyme catalyze "query"
enzyme catalyze "query" --target ./target-dir
```

Present it as: "I searched your own notes for the internal thread, then searched the external material through the same conceptual frame." The vault is the lens; `apply` may miss themes that exist only in the target and not in the user's vault.

### `enzyme refresh` / `enzyme status`

```bash
enzyme refresh --quiet    # incremental, skips if unchanged
enzyme status             # doc count, entity count, coverage
```

### JSON output

**petri**: `name`, `type`, `frequency`, `activity_trend`, `catalysts` (array of `{ text, context }`)

**catalyze**: `results` (array of `{ file_path, content, similarity }`), `top_contributing_catalysts`, `presentation_guidance`

## Writing Notes

Write memory as ordinary markdown, not as a separate memory store. The point is to leave useful notes that Enzyme can refresh and retrieve through Petri, Catalyze, and Apply.

The best time to write is near the end of a session or after a meaningful decision, when the durable outcome is clear. Don't interrupt the user's flow to capture routine Q&A.

Write a note when a session produces a decision, a reframe, an open thread worth returning to, a durable preference, a project state change, or useful people/company context.

Do not write a note for raw tool output, one-time commands, transient status, generic summaries, or facts already captured without material change. Never store secrets, credentials, tokens, or raw config values; if relevant, record only that a credential was configured.

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS topic.md` in the capture folder.

```markdown
---
tags:
  - existing-tag
created: '[[YYYY-MM-DD]]'
---

## descriptive title

The decision or insight in 2-3 sentences. Why it matters.

The tradeoff, the rejected alternative, or what's still open.

Related: [[existing note]]
```

Before writing, use `enzyme petri`, `enzyme catalyze`, or exact search to find related notes. Link to existing notes when possible.

Use existing tags — check petri entities before inventing new ones. Use wikilinks to connect to existing notes. One idea per file. Keep it short.

When writing into an existing Obsidian vault, follow its current folder and frontmatter conventions. If the vault has people/contact pages, link them instead of creating parallel names. If no people/company folder exists, use wikilinks and existing tags before proposing a new structure. If no convention exists, ask before introducing a capture folder, date field, people folder, or context-tree-like structure.

For entities that apply to the whole note, prefer existing frontmatter fields over repeating names throughout the body. Include only central people, organizations, clients, companies, projects, tags, or relationships from the retrieved context. Use inline wikilinks where a mention matters locally in the prose. Do not add new entity fields unless the vault already uses them or the user approves the convention.

If a previous decision is superseded, write a new note referencing the old one rather than editing it.

After writing memory notes at the end of the session, run:

```bash
enzyme refresh --quiet
```

Refresh is the Enzyme equivalent of making the new memory live. It re-indexes changed markdown and updates catalyst retrieval; no background dreaming or consolidation pass is required.

## Presentation

Lead with the user's own words from matched excerpts. For vault overviews, name something the user is doing across the vault, then ground it with concrete source breadcrumbs. For search results, use any `presentation_guidance` returned in JSON, notice tensions across results, and suggest specific next searches using catalyst language.

Never expose tool names to the user. Never open with energy assessments of the vault.
